Permission Issues

Sometimes application sees device but can not connect it due lack of permissions. Usually, pocketVna shows RED information on the right-bottom corner and shows orange message box.

pocketVna application uses libudev to access device. 
Sometimes regular (non-admin) user does not have permission to open/read/write usb device. The main sign of this issue: application sees device but can not connect against it.

You can either 
  -- Start application via sudo
  -- Add permission like "666" to corresponsing udev-device. For example in ubuntu it locates somewhere /dev/hidraw*
  -- Add udev rule. 

------------------------------

udev rule
On most modern distributions (Ubuntu 14, Fedora 22, OpenSuse it should be located in 
   /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/  #looks does not exist on some elder distributions like Ubuntu 12
   /etc/udev/rules.d/

Create a new rule or add into existing one following line
	SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", MODE="0666"

Next command shows udev device info. It shows parametters that could be used exactly "as is" in rule
udevadm info --path=path/to/device --attribute-walk   

------------------------------

We provide 98-pocketvna-udev.rules file. Just copy it into one of the locations above. And reload udev (or restart the computer)
To reload udev use the following command:
  udevadm control --reload && udevadm trigger           # restart udev applying newly created rule

------------------------------
For convenience there is installPocketVNArule.sh. It installs rules file for you or uninstall it. Call (probably using sudo/su or admin rights)
	./installPocketVNArule.sh
And uninstall rule, you can call (probably sudo or admin rights are required)
	./installPocketVNArule.sh uninstall
